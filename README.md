<h2>The Follies of Democratic Imperialism</h2>
<cite>Omar G. Encarnación</cite>

President George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq signaled the unambiguous return of 
“democratic imperialism” in American foreign policy. Entailing what is tantamount to the 
imposition of democracy upon a foreign country, this can be seen as the ultimate 
manifestation of America’s traditional obsession with its role as a global moral crusader.1

Bringing freedom and democracy to Iraq is expected to impart a “domino-like” effect 
throughout the Middle East, resulting in the collapse of one autocracy after another.
President Bush elaborated his vision in a speech to the American Enterprise Institute
(AEI) on February 27, 2003, by any measure a presidential manifesto on the virtues of
spreading democracy abroad. Removing Saddam Hussein from power and replacing
him with a democratically elected government, Bush asserted, “would serve as a dramatic 
and inspiring example of freedom for other nations in the region.”2
This robust rebirth of democratic imperialism could hardly have been imagined only a few 
years ago. As a candidate in 2000, Bush faulted the Clinton administration for its 
intervention in Haiti in 1994 with the goal of restoring democracy there as well as
for its “humanitarian interventions” in Somalia and Kosovo. His stance was in keeping 
with the conservative realpolitik of his closest advisers, who regarded the moralistic
impulse in American foreign policy as at best a distraction and at worst counterproductive.3 
It was now Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice who then advised Bush to adopt a hard-nosed 
realist view of international relations that left little room for the spread of democracy 
by force or other means.4 Her predecessor at the State Department, Colin Powell, who Bush 
entrusted with the task of selling the war in Iraq to the world, had opposed ousting 
Saddam Hussein during the first Gulf war and advised against intervention to stop genocide
in Bosnia, contending that neither case posed a threat to the national interest. Indeed, 
the attempt to democratize the Middle East is little short of revolutionary. Unlike in 
Asia, Africa, and especially Latin America, promoting democracy in the Middle East has 
never been an explicit U.S. goal. Over the years, American policymakers have been 
reticent to push democratization there on the grounds that friendly authoritarians in 
Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt provided a defense against the spread of radical Islam. 
Conventional wisdom held that the advent of real reforms in the Arab world could result 
in legitimately elected Islamist governments that were “anti-American and ultimately 
anti-democratic in orientation.”5 This scenario materialized in Algeria during the 
1990s. To prevent the all-but-certain electoral victory of the Islamic Salvation 
Front (FIS), the Algerian military staged a coup in January 1992, condoned by the 
United States and other Western powers, which opened the way for a civil war that 
has claimed an estimated 150,000 lives.

September 11 was obviously the most
important factor behind the roaring return
of democratic imperialism. The events of
that fateful day engendered the belief that
Islamic authoritarianism nurtured political
extremism, and that the essential corrective was the democratization of the Muslim, and especially the Arab, world. As
expounded by Under Secretary of State
Paula Dobriansky, “The advancement of
human rights and democracy is the bedrock of our war on terrorism. A stable government that responds to the legitimate
desires of its people and respects their
rights, and shares power is a powerful antidote to extremism.”6 These views echoed
influential neoconservative voices in the
Bush administration who maintained that
American power should not be limited to
the defense of vital interests but should
also be employed to defeat ideologies opposing freedom and democracy.7 Deputy
Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, a
pivotal figure in the “neocon” movement,
argued that the challenge facing the United
States after 9/11 was far wider than a fight
against terrorism: “It is a war of ideas, a
struggle over modernity and secularism,
pluralism and democracy and real economic
development.”8
However outwardly attractive and compelling, the return of democratic imperialism is rooted in faulty premises that are
not merely quixotic but actually counterproductive in spreading democracy, peace,
and order around the world. These “follies
of democratic imperialism,” as I call them,
were first formulated by President Woodrow Wilson to justify his democratic crusades in Latin America during an earlier
era when America’s imperial impulses were
in full bloom. They have been adopted
virtually unvarnished eight decades later
by President Bush, “the most Wilsonian
president since Wilson himself,”9 conjuring
the image of America as “the New Rome.”10
Oddly, the ideals underpinning democratic
imperialism are probably more problematic
today than when they were first unveiled.
Now, as then, they encourage false and unrealistic expectations about the benefits of
spreading democracy abroad and the capacity of the United States to develop
democratic practices in places where none
existed before.
From Wilson to Bush: Quixotic Ideals
In sending U.S. troops to Mexico in 1914
with the intention of toppling the dictatorship of Gen. Victoriano Huerta, who had
seized power through a violent coup the
year before, Wilson articulated three principles that comprise the essence of “Wilsonianism,” and by extension, democratic imperialism. First is the view that spreading
democracy abroad, even by force, is an unqualified blessing. Wilson saw democracy as
the source of trust, order, and peace in international relations. “A steadfast concert of
peace can never be maintained except by a
partnership of democratic nations. No autocratic government could be trusted to keep
faith within it or observe its covenants,” declared Wilson as he dispatched the Marines
to occupy the port of Veracruz and force a
showdown with what he called “a government of butchers.”11 Wilson’s faith flowed
from what is known today as “democratic
peace theory,” which contends that democracies, owing to their very constitution, do
not go to war with each other.
12 Thus, Wilson reasoned, the more democratic the
world, the more peaceful it would become.
Second was Wilson’s belief in democracy
as a universal value capable of succeeding
everywhere. “There is no people not fitted
for self government,” asserted Wilson as he
undertook to bring “an orderly and righteous government” to Mexico.13 This cut
against the grain of the era’s conventional
wisdom about Latin America, given its
Catholic faith, colonial experience, warm
climate, mixed racial heritage, and presumed volatile temperament.14 A New York
Times editorial published at the time of Wilson’s intervention in Mexico observed that a
great part of the Latin American public was
“hopelessly ignorant while those of high intelligence, often of pure Spanish blood and
free from that racial mixture which has been
so prolific, remain aloof from politics.”15
48 WORLD POLICY JOURNAL • SPRING 2005
Finally, there was Wilson’s conviction
that America was the bearer of the moral
task of democratizing the world. He believed that “as the definite example of
democracy, the United States had a special
obligation to extend its benefits and to instruct backward peoples in its uses.”16 This
was squarely within the tradition that it was
America’s “manifest destiny” to create “an
exemplary state separate from the corrupt
and fallen world devoted to pushing the
world along by means of regenerative intervention.”17 Such a providential mandate was
rooted in America’s unique history: its revolutionary origins, its republican and federal
constitution, and its flourishing economy. In
Wilson’s words: “We are friends of constitutional government in America; we are more
than its friends, we are its champions. I am
going to teach the South American republics to elect good men!”18 This mission
required a hands-on approach, as Wilson
stressed in his struggle to redeem Mexico:
The duty of the United States was
not to act as a policeman who established order and then left, but rather
to provide a strong guiding hand of
the great nation on this continent.
America must assist these warring
people back to the path of quiet and
prosperity. After that was accomplished, the United States might
leave the Mexicans to work out their
own destiny watching them narrowly and insisting that they shall take
help when help is needed.19
Although separated by nearly a century,
Wilson’s zeal for changing the world anticipates Bush’s in strikingly similar ways. “The
world has a clear interest in the spread of
democratic values because stable and free
nations do not breed ideologies of murder.
They encourage the peaceful pursuit of a
better life,” the president asserted in his AEI
speech. In a subsequent address at Whitehall in London in November 2003 meant to
shore up European support for the war in
Iraq, Bush reiterated the theme: “Democracy and the hope and progress it brings are
the alternative to instability and to hatred
and terror. Lasting peace is gained as justice
and democracy advance.”
Like Wilson, Bush alludes to the universal appeal of democracy, especially in connection to the Middle East which, like Latin
America in years past, is today regarded by
many as culturally unsuited to democracy.
This view has its roots in the perceived incompatibility of Islam and democracy and is
underscored by the fact that not a single
Arab society can credibly be deemed democratic.20 No less an authority than Princeton’s Bernard Lewis, the doyen of Middle
East studies, has stated that “Islam is incompatible with democracy as the fundamentalists themselves would be the first to
say: they regard liberal democracy as a corrupt and corrupting form of government.”21
To such skeptics Bush responds: “It is presumptuous and insulting to suggest that a
whole region of the world or the one fifth of
humanity that is Muslim is somehow untouched by the most basic aspirations of life.
Human cultures can be vastly different, yet
the human heart desires the same good
things everywhere on earth.”
And like Wilson, Bush sees America as
the chosen agent for transforming the
world. “By the resolve and purpose of
America and of our friends and allies, we
will make this an age of progress and
liberty. Free people will set the course of
history,” Bush proclaimed in his AEI speech.
As with Wilson, this mandate to spread
democracy is joined to heavily messianic
language intended to convey a highly ethical (if not providential) purpose to American
foreign policy. “Freedom is the Almighty’s
gift to every man and woman in this
world,” said the president at the April 13,
2004 press conference defending his policy
in Iraq. “And as the greatest power on the
face of the earth, we have an obligation to
help the spread of freedom.”
The Follies of Democratic Imperialism 49
Despite their allure, these lofty goals
account for many a misguided attempt to
impose democracy upon others. Especially
telling is the fate of Wilson’s crusade in
Latin America. He had hoped that uprooting despotic regimes in countries like Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and
Nicaragua would serve as an antidote to revolution. But the democracies fostered by
his administration in 1914–21 collapsed almost as soon as they were created. In a cruel
twist of fate, some of the regimes born out
of the American occupation turned out to
be more violent and repressive than their
predecessors.
It does not follow, certainly, that Wilson’s experience in Latin America will repeat
itself in Iraq. Still, it is instructive that the
same misguided principles that doomed
Wilson’s project in Latin America explain
much of what has already gone wrong in
Iraq.22 Although it is premature to declare
the American mission in Iraq a failure, it is
obvious to everyone including its architects
in Washington and Baghdad that things
have not turned out the way they were once
envisioned. Two years after the arrival of the
Americans, the goal of creating a viable
Iraqi democracy remains no more likely
than the rise of a dictatorship with Islamic
fundamentalists at the helm, or worse yet, a
civil war.
Misreading the Democratic Peace
At first glance, the reliance of American
presidents on democratic peace theory to
rationalize democratic imperialism appears
to rest on solid footing. Democratic peace
theory is, after all, “the closest thing we
have to an empirical law in international
relations.”23 Although it is not true that
democracies never go to war with each other, it is an irrefutable fact that they rarely do
so.24 According to the Economist, of the 416
wars between sovereign states recorded between 1816 and 1980, only 12 were fought
between democracies.25 But this aversion
that democracies appear to have toward war,
however real, is a problematic assumption
upon which to build policies of coercive democratization.
The most serious objection is that democratic peace theory leads to an anachronistic way of thinking about war and peace in
our own era. While ending wars between
states might have given hope for world
peace during Wilson’s era, this is hardly the
case today. The classic view of war as an epic
struggle between rival states has been out of
date for decades. Nothing suggests this better than the ongoing war on terror. The enemy is not another state but rather an array
of cells scattered around the globe. These
cells, as in the case of Osama bin Laden’s alQaeda organization, operate not only in autocratic states but also in democracies such
as the United States, Britain, and Spain.
Moreover, the greatest sources of instability nowadays are ethnic and religious differences that tend to fuel “intrastate” rather
than “interstate” wars. Alas, democratic
peace theory does not apply to civil wars,
which are harder to contain. Consequently,
despite the dramatic spread of democratic
governance (depending upon the criteria, as
many as three dozen new democracies have
been created since the mid-1970s), this appears to have had little discernable impact
on diminishing global anarchy, violence,
and indeed war.26 According to a study of
violent conflicts by Ted Gurr of the University of Maryland, since 1945 ethnic conflict
has played a major role in half of all wars
and is responsible for millions of deaths and
countless refugees. This would appear to
suggest that American administrations interested in advancing international peace
and order would be better off devising ways
to ameliorate conditions that lead to civil
war than promoting democracy per se.
The use of democratic peace theory to
justify democratic imperialism also suggests
an impoverished understanding of the theory. In declaring that democracies do not
attack each other or breed murderous ideologies, advocates fail to appreciate that
50 WORLD POLICY JOURNAL • SPRING 2005
The Follies of Democratic Imperialism 51
this proposition applies exclusively to advanced democratic societies. Only stable and
mature democracies possess the structural
and normative requirements believed to
make democracies averse to war, including
checks and balances within the political system and societal acceptance of liberal values.
These conditions do not develop overnight
and are generally in short supply in democratizing states. Unsurprisingly, there is a
well-documented affinity between democratization and conflict, which suggests that
during the early phases of democratization,
countries become “more aggressive and warprone, not less, and they fight wars with
democratic states.”27 This risk appears greatest in states making the sudden leap from
total autocracy to mass democracy. By most
indicators, this would surely include Iraq
and virtually the entire Middle East.
Among the conditions that make democratizing states likely to attack other
states is rising nationalism, which often
goes hand in hand with the advent of
democracy. The “intoxicating brew of nationalism and incipient democratization,”
explain Columbia University professors Edward D. Mansfield and Jack Snyder, creates
favorable conditions for driving a nation toward war. Democratizing states that show
strong proclivities toward aggression include postcommunist Russia, where economic distress and belligerent nationalism
has contributed to the climate that led to a
bloody conflict in Chechnya. In Serbia, the
political and military elites facing pressures
for democratization cynically created a new
basis for legitimacy through nationalist
propaganda and aggressive military action
against neighbors. Even Spain, the darling
of democratization scholars, saw its reputation tarnished for having conducted a “dirty
war” against Basque separatist groups following the demise of Generalissimo Francisco Franco’s 40-year dictatorship. For its
part, the chaos and terror spawned by
groups such as the Euskadi Ta Askatasuna
(ETA) since the advent of Spanish democracy
in 1977 strikingly belies the notion that
democracy is a cure-all prescription for
curbing political radicalism.
A final consideration is the oft-noted
“dark side” of democratic peace theory. In
the name of promoting democracy, liberal
states are likely to resort to illiberal means.
This contradiction has cast the United
States in the odd role of a “peace loving aggressor” which uses the pretext of spreading
democracy to attack and invade other countries. This scenario was first realized under
Wilson in his ill-fated attempt to impose
democracy by force on Latin American
countries and is being resuscitated by Bush
in Iraq. The paradoxical outcome is to undercut the capacity of the United States to
engender peace, order, and cooperation
around the world. Indeed, promoting
democracy may lead to conflict, disorder
and mistrust.
Wilson was caught off guard by the resistance and rise of a nationalist backlash
provoked by his military intervention in
Mexico in 1914. He had predicted that the
Mexicans “would come to respect the
strength of character of the Marines.”28 Instead, the political class rallied around the
Huerta dictatorship and denounced Wilson
for his interventionist policies. Thousands of
Mexicans volunteered to fight the invading
Americans, and at U.S. consulates flags were
burned. Clashes occurred along the U.S.-
Mexican border and anti-American riots
broke out in Mexico City, spreading to Costa Rica, Guatemala, Chile, Ecuador, and
Uruguay. This crisis grew so serious that
Argentina, Brazil, and Chile offered to step
in and mediate a settlement between the
Huerta government and Washington. At
the Niagara Falls, Ontario, mediation conference of May-June 1914, Wilson’s insistence that Huerta relinquish power and order free elections startled the South American mediators and led to the conference’s
failure.
Having shown himself an aggressor in
his dealings with Mexico, Wilson saw his
plans for a Pan American Treaty opposed
and eventually derailed because constitutional democracies like Argentina and Chile
feared U.S. meddling in their internal affairs. Argentine and Chilean leaders believed
the United States “aimed at domination in
Latin America” and “feared that the Treaty’s
requirement for a republican form of government” would tend to erect United States
tutelage over Latin America.29 In the end,
the treaty perished, “a victim of the belief
that although Wilson had renounced overt
imperialism, his interventionism, the
growth of American economic influence,
and his insistence on political conformity all
added up to a sort of informal imperialism
that was just as objectionable as the cruder
colonialism of an earlier day.”30
The Bush White House has already
tasted the paradoxical and unintended consequences of democratic imperialism. In the
apt words of one analyst, postwar Iraq has
become “a jobs program for jihadists worldwide,” a direct reference to the way in
which the invasion of Iraq has emboldened
terrorists throughout the Islamic world,
many of whom have flocked to Iraq to fight
Americans.31 This, in turn, has hardly
helped in making Iraq into a positive
model; among ordinary Arabs, Iraq’s example has seemed “more alarming than inspiring.”32 Many view Iraq as a chaotic and violent land where thousands of civilians have
been killed due to the occupation. They also
regard the United States less as a purveyor
of freedom and democracy, as Washington
had hoped, than as the latest in a string of
foreign powers attempting to subjugate
their region. This negative perception has
been hardened by human rights abuses at
Abu Ghraib prison and the protection accorded to Iraq’s oil reserves while the country’s cultural assets were left vulnerable to
looters and robbers.
Beyond the Middle East, the consequences of the American-led war in Iraq are
readily evident. Most notable is the damage
done to the United Nations and longstanding relationships with France and Germany,
prompting some to lament “the death of
American internationalism.”33 Anti-Americanism abroad, virtually extinct in the aftermath of 9/11, reached unprecedented
heights and is currently frustrating efforts
by the Bush administration to secure international support for the reconstruction of
Iraq.
The Bush administration has also been
willing to undermine democracy in some
countries in its attempt to spread it to others, including, paradoxically, places where
the United States has actively supported democratization. Mexico and Chile, two members of the U.N. Security Council that refused to endorse a resolution authorizing
American military action against Iraq, incurred the wrath of Washington for essentially reflecting popular sentiment, which in
both cases was overwhelmingly opposed to
the war. American officials assumed that
Turkey, a country that Washington hopes
will become a model of democracy for the
Muslim world, would support an attack on
Iraq, as it did in the first Gulf war. Once it
seemed clear that any agreement with the
Bush administration would be subjected to
parliamentary approval, the United States
tried to circumvent the process by essentially bribing Turkish politicians with economic and military aid. As one Turkish
politician noted, “They [the Americans]
were used to dealing with our generals
and not with politicians trying to be democratic.”34 The Bush administration underscored this very paradox while struggling
to explain Turkey’s failure to support the
American position in Iraq. Reflecting on
the negative vote against the United States,
Wolfowitz criticized Turkey’s military “for
not playing the strong leadership role we
would have expected.”
Misunderstanding Democratization
The thesis that democracy can grow in virtually any soil is inherently appealing and
even enlightened; what could be more ideal52 WORLD POLICY JOURNAL • SPRING 2005
istic than the notion that no culture is inimical to democracy? It may be true as well.
Plenty of countries once condemned to perpetual authoritarian rule have managed to
reinvent themselves as thriving democracies.
The nations of Latin America during Wilson’s time were regarded as a cesspool of authoritarian vices; nowadays, with the obvious exception of Cuba, they are ruled entirely by democratic governments. Spain
and Portugal, paradigmatic examples of corporatism and dictatorship through the mid1970s, are today highly successful pluralist
democracies. Germany and Japan, two other
miracles of postwar democratization, were
once regarded as infertile ground for democracy due to the conformist culture of their
people and the authoritarian orientation of
their political leaders.
What appears to have turned former authoritarian enclaves into democratic models
is the capacity to nurture internal conditions
favorable to the maintenance of democracy.
These generally include a civic culture able
to accommodate compromise as well as dissent and pluralism, significant social and
economic development, a strong sense of national identity, stable and competent political institutions, and a free and vibrant civil
society. Whether these are “preconditions”
or “by-products” of democracy and how precisely they facilitate democracy remains a
source of debate among social scientists. But
two things about the rise of these conditions
are clear, which American presidents tend to
overlook.
First, attaining the conditions that favor
the installation and maintenance of democracy is a long-term process not immune to
backsliding. It cannot be abbreviated, expedited, or circumvented by introducing political practices such as free elections and a
democratic constitution. As Wilson learned
in Latin America, “electoralism” and “constitutionalism” do not guarantee democracy;
indeed, they do not even ensure its survival.
The attempt to impose democratic practices
throughout Mexico, Central America, and
the Caribbean in the years between 1913
and 1921 failed to yield stable democratic
governance. In the wake of the American intervention of 1914, the Mexican political
class turned not only authoritarian and nationalistic but also intensely anti-American.
Democracy would not arrive in Mexico until
2000, following decades of economic and
political modernization. In Central America
and the Caribbean, Wilson’s military occupations and attempts at creating democracy
paved the way for a new generation of brutal
tyrannies, including those of Fulgencio
Batista in Cuba, Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, and Anastasio Somoza in
Nicaragua.
The reasons for the failure of Wilson’s
policy in Latin America include some of the
same ones that prevented democracy from
taking root in the aftermath of Iberian colonialism. Most republics that were created
during the 1820s and 1830s adopted democratic institutions of their own free will and
most, interestingly, took the American Constitution and presidential political system as
their model. But few of these democracies
were able to overcome their undemocratic
colonial legacies, especially an illiberal ruling class, a powerful and reactionary
Catholic Church, widespread poverty, and
underdeveloped state institutions. Postindependence, this hindered a consensus on national identity, the development of coherent
political institutions and autonomous civil
societies, and respect for the rule of law. Reverting to authoritarianism seemed almost
natural after democratic politics proved
chaotic and unable to solve pressing social
issues. Small wonder that in the end Wilson
came to accept authoritarianism in a Mexico
led by revolutionists “because he had become convinced that agrarian and other socioeconomic reforms were more pressing
than electoralism.”35
Second, although the United States can
assist in encouraging the conditions that favor democracy, it can neither create them
nor sufficiently develop them to determine
The Follies of Democratic Imperialism 53
whether democracy succeeds or fails in the
long term. As noted by the Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington, “There is
little that the United States can do to alter
the basic cultural tradition and social structure of another society or to promote compromise among groups of that society that
have been killing each other.”36 Instead, the
conditions that favor democracy depend for
their emergence largely upon the political
skills of a given society. This is the lesson
we can absorb from the experience of Germany and Japan, two countries where
democracy’s success is often linked to an effective American occupation. “Because we
and our allies were steadfast, Germany and
Japan are democratic nations that no longer
threaten the world,” remarked Bush in a
speech, “Freedom in Iraq and the Middle
East,” delivered on November 6, 2003, on
the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of
the National Endowment for Democracy.
However, much of the historiography on
the democratization of postwar Germany
and Japan cautions about giving too much
credit to America for having engineered a
democratic miracle.37 It suggests instead
that the talents and determination of the
German and Japanese people (rather than
those of the American occupying forces)
were in the end chiefly responsible for their
transformation. Many of the democratization schemes designed by the Americans
were aborted, canceled, or evaded by the
local governments soon after the Cold War
broke out. Additionally, this scholarship
stresses other conditions favoring democracy,
a point some observers believe has been
overlooked in comparisons between the
American intervention in Japan and Germany and Iraq.38 Prior to the Second World
War, Germany and Japan were economic
powerhouses with a strong sense of national
identity facilitated by ethnic homogeneity
and well-developed state bureaucracies. Indeed, it was economic might and ultranationalism that made these countries such
formidable military powers. Both countries
were also eager to return to the generally
democratic life they had during the interwar
period. Although flawed and unstable,
Japan’s Taisho democracy and Germany’s
Weimar Republic provided templates for
the re-creation of democracy.
Paradoxically, Iraq, where a demonstration effect is expected to serve as a catalyst
for spreading democracy across the Middle
East, presents one of the most challenging
environments for democracy. There is a
dearth of democratic consciousness within
Iraqi political society. While political pluralism is on the rise, it is hard to gauge the
intentions of nascent parties and social
movements. Some of the country’s most
powerful political organizations, such as
those headed by powerful Shiite clerics, including Muqtada al-Sadr, the young cleric
who incited the Fallujah uprising in April
2004, and the all-powerful Grand Ayatollah
Ali al-Sistani, Iraq’s most respected religious
leader, participated in the country’s first
democratic elections. But as the Iraqi people
begin the process of crafting a new constitution it is unclear how committed to the
democratic process these groups actually are.
Many of them are calling for the merging of
religious and secular authority so typical of
other Middle Eastern societies, notably
Iran.39 They also oppose many liberal reforms (such as granting rights to women)
and regard America as a purveyor of values
that stand in contrast to their cherished traditional order.
Moreover, under Saddam, the state bureaucracy in Iraq did not function as a coherent, merit-based system (as was largely
true of prewar Germany and Japan) but
rather as something more typical of Latin
America during Wilson’s time: a hotbed of
clientelism, corruption, and loyalty toward
the dictator.
40 Equally worrisome are Iraq’s
economic prospects. In recent decades, Iraq
has experienced a staggering reversal of development, best suggested by the collapse of
per capita income. In 1979, when Saddam
Hussein came to power, Iraq’s per capita
54 WORLD POLICY JOURNAL • SPRING 2005
GNP stood at $12,000—twenty-first in the
world, ahead of Spain and Hong Kong. Today it stands at less than $3,000, behind the
Philippines and Ecuador.41 According to democratization experts, for democracy to endure in Iraq, per capita income will need to
almost double (to $5,500).42 This is a tall
order, to be sure; one that the Bush administration hopes will be made possible by
Iraq’s oil riches. But this assumption is
contradicted by cross-national data on the
connection between oil and democracy. In
Indonesia, Nigeria, Mexico, Venezuela,
and much of the Middle East, an oil-dependent economy has become the seedbed
for authoritarianism, corruption, and civil
war. Indeed, the collective experience of
these nations has given rise to the so-called
resource curse, with oil becoming a hindrance to rather than a facilitator of
democracy.
The picture of civil society, the social actor believed to grease the wheels of democracy by inculcating such public values as
trust and tolerance and by providing a
sturdy defense against state abuses, is also
bleak, to say the least. Islamist groups, the
most prominent face of civil society in Iraq
and across the Middle East, do not commonly frame their objectives in terms of
democratic values. Many of them have in
recent years moved to fill the void left behind by a failing government by offering a
wide range of social services from education
and transportation to healthcare. But this
has come at the expense of the general “Islamization” and radicalization of society resulting from the rigid and often intolerant
character of religious organizations now performing functions previously in the hands of
state authorities.43
Lastly, there is Iraq’s ethnic and religious diversity, with Shia in the south, Sunnis in the center, and Kurds in the north.
This volatile mix discourages a strong sense
of national identity, making it difficult for
democratization to rest on widespread societal solidarity. It also increases the possibility
that democracy will become a source of conflict in its own right. In the last three
decades, few multiethnic states have been
able to orchestrate a successful transition to
democracy: witness the case of the Soviet
Union and its successor states (most notably
those in Central Asia and the Caucasus).
More tragically, there is the case of Yugoslavia, where “ethnic cleansing” was an early
fruit of majority rule. Ironically, contributing to the collapse of these states as they undertook to democratize was the existence of
federalist structures, which the Bush administration seemingly regards as a prescription
for dealing with Iraq’s ethnic divisions.
The Perils of Imposing Democracy
The belief that the United States is uniquely
endowed and therefore especially burdened
with the task of spreading democracy is
problematic on many fronts. Efforts by
American presidents to articulate this mission have often had unintended consequences. Early references to the war in Iraq
as a democratizing “crusade” were dropped
from Bush’s speeches once reports from the
Middle East indicated how offensive the
term was to local audiences. More problematic are the political dynamics unleashed by
the imposition of democracy. Democratic
imperialism entails the fundamental paradox of making the transition to democracy
more complicated than it otherwise would
be. The liberalization of a people from dictatorship by an external force entails the
abrupt, usually violent, end of the old
regime. This mode of regime change is effective in purging authoritarian forces
deeply ensconced within the bureaucratic
structures of the state. But it sets an inauspicious stage for the transition to democracy
by creating a void in political authority, not
to speak of the considerable chaos that can
ensue.
Iraq tellingly suggests how an occupation can itself become an obstacle to democratization. The “systematic looting and destruction of practically every public buildThe Follies of Democratic Imperialism 55
ing in Baghdad” created by the American
invasion made restoring basic services such
as electricity more difficult to accomplish
while imbuing the emerging political culture with a great deal of incivility.44 More
serious was the vacuum in political authority created with the sudden passing of the
old regime. A month into the military occupation, U.S. administrator Paul Bremer announced the disbanding of the Iraqi Republican Army, some 400,000 strong, and the
lustration of 50,000 members of the Baath
Party. The aim was laudable: to cleanse Iraq
of Saddam’s political influence once and for
all. Unintentionally, Bremer’s actions created a formidable resistance to American authority and exacerbated the fault lines of
domestic political conflict. As reported by
one Iraqi observer, “May 15 was the day
the United States made 450,000 enemies
in Iraq.”45 This resistance is, if anything,
stronger than ever, and in an effort to stamp
out the violence spawned by terrorist
groups, Iraq’s new leaders have curtailed
civil and political freedoms.
Another flaw in America’s self-anointed
role as a democratic crusader is that it entails creating democracy through undemocratic means. Imposing democracy requires
one country to intrude itself in the political
affairs of another country, thereby robbing
democracy of its indigenous legitimacy. Arguably the most intrusive step in the imposition of democracy is the creation of an interim or provisional government. They are
generally designed to meet short-term interests, such as securing political order, rather
than the more complex task of developing
democratic institutions. Less intrusive but
equally problematic is the staging of postoccupation elections, a key benchmark of
democratic imperialism. In an attempt to
ensure the desired outcome, the invading
power will likely seek to influence (if not
manipulate) the elections by deciding what
groups can participate and which cannot.
Wilson’s experience in Latin America
vividly illustrates how external intervention
in the construction of democracy is hardly
an exercise in democracy. His administration
wrote electoral laws and constitutions, and
went so far as to encourage or discourage
particular candidates or parties, seeking
those most likely to govern effectively (and
to serve U.S. interests). Unsurprisingly,
forced and manipulated elections often provoked internal disputes. Complicating matters, many of the institutions relied upon to
guarantee the survival of democracy evinced
scant respect for democracy and its values.
The task of consolidating democratic political life was often given to the military, ushering in a long and tragic history of military
intervention in politics.
The case of the Dominican Republic is
especially instructive. The United States
ruled the country between 1916 and 1924,
and oversaw the organization of the judiciary, the Treasury, and the Ministry of Agriculture, and the creation of a provisional
government in 1922. Before leaving, the
Americans also created a national constabulary (national guard) in the hope of improving the capacity of civilian leaders to sustain
constitutional rule. This was meant to “depoliticize the armed forces, serving to bolster stable, constitutional government.”46
This strategy backfired spectacularly. Soon
after the Americans left, the Dominican Republic plunged into a civil war that ended
in 1930 when Trujillo assumed control by
virtue of his command of the National
Guard. Trujillo abolished the liberal reforms
instituted by the Americans, harshly repressed the opposition, and terrorized the
country’s neighbors, not least by massacring
some 12,000 Haitians along the HaitianDominican border in 1937. “Wilson’s
dreams of a constitutional order had become
a nightmare,” concludes one scholar of Wilson’s Dominican policy.
47
Similar dynamics to those of the Latin
American experience are already visible in
Iraq. There is the obvious lack of legitimacy
of the interim governments the Americans
have installed in the country. The Iraqi
56 WORLD POLICY JOURNAL • SPRING 2005
Governing Council, dismantled in June
2003, was widely criticized for its lack of
autonomy, for consisting primarily of Iraqi
exiles, and for failing to incorporate the
whole spectrum of Iraqi political factions.
The same fate befell the “sovereign” government inaugurated on June 28, 2004, led by
its American-approved head, Iyad Alawi,
the former president of the Governing
Council. Charges that these governments
were essentially a cover for Washington
were underscored by the restrictions on national autonomy incorporated into the declaration of sovereignty likely to perpetuate
American control of Iraq for years. As of
this writing, Iraq continues to be ruled by
edicts enacted by the Bremer administration
covering a wide range of subjects from
crime to the economy to foreign affairs, including shielding every U.S. soldier, coalition employee, and private contractor from
Iraqi law.
In Iraq, as in Latin America, the United
States is employing intrusive political engineering with uncertain consequences for the
development of democracy. Iraq’s first free
democratic elections, remarkable in many
respects, failed to become a symbol of national unity and reconciliation. To the contrary, the Sunni parties boycotted the elections on the grounds that they lacked legitimacy since the voting was taking place under the American occupation. Yet to be
worked out are a new democratic constitution and the relationship between the new
Iraqi government and the thousands of
Americans expected to remain in the country. How the United States manages these
sensitive tasks will play a critical role in determining whether the new government is
perceived to be legitimate and working toward Iraqi, rather than American, interests.
Finally, America’s commitment to
spreading democracy is often at odds with
the reality of protecting the “national interest,” as defined by strategic economic and
political goals. Reconciling these often contradictory objectives leaves U.S. foreign policy vulnerable to the criticism of being inconsistent, even hypocritical. It was this
clash between professed ideals and the pursuit of the national interest that ended Wilson’s efforts to impose democracy in Latin
America. His administration found it very
difficult to insist on a uniform standard of
democracy since Wilson was unprepared to
defend the policy across the region. It was
applied uniformly and coercively to the nations of Central America, the Caribbean,
and Mexico, but ran afoul in South America,
where Wilson was less willing to deny
diplomatic recognition to authoritarian governments, much less to intervene militarily
against an autocratic regime. In Peru in
1913, and again in 1919, the Wilson administration denied recognition to a provisional government because it had been established by force. However, Wilson later
reversed course and granted recognition
anyway.
The Bush administration is similarly
caught between its desire to spread democracy and the pursuit of such “national interests” as fighting terrorism, giving American
policy in the Middle East an egregious
“split personality.”48 Despite his ringing
calls for democracy, President Bush actively
cultivates warm relations with numerous regional tyrants. The evident hypocrisy of this
approach was vividly demonstrated during
his June 2003 visit to the Middle East.
Rather than pressing the leaders of Bahrain,
Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia to implement democratic reforms, the president
spent almost all of his time talking about
the fight against terrorism and extremist
groups. This only reinforced “the widespread perception that the United States
uses democracy as a whip to punish its
enemies, like Iraq, while doing business as
usual with its autocratic allies.”49
A Second Look at Democratic Imperialism
The inescapable realities of Iraq are gradually forcing a second look at democratic imperialism. Speculation about the next target
The Follies of Democratic Imperialism 57
in the Middle East for coercive democratization (Syria or Iran?), which was intense following the invasion of Iraq, has decreased.
Neoconservatives are contending with a
resurgent “realpolitik” critique of American
policy in Iraq.50 The National Review, a bible
of conservative thought, has already dismissed the Wilsonian ideal of implanting
democracy in Iraq and has recommended instead settling for an orderly society with a
nondictatorial regime.51 This rising skepticism is welcome, although one hopes it does
not signify deemphasizing democracy in
American foreign policy. Despite the many
faulty principles that over the years have
mocked American efforts, the United States
remains the main force for democratic
change around the world. The real issue is
what type of democratic promotion is best
suited to advancing democracy abroad.
America’s own experience with democratic promotion suggests that this mission
is most effective when its coercive, heavyhanded approaches are checked and its energies focused instead on facilitating the conditions that enable nations to embrace
democracy of their own free will: promoting
human rights, alleviating poverty, and
building effective governing institutions.
These were the policies that helped the people of Latin America and the former Communist bloc embrace democracy. The Republican president who subsequently sought
to repair relations with Latin America following Wilson’s aggressive attempts to democratize the region understood this point.
While traveling throughout South America
in 1928, President Herbert Hoover promised to promote democracy by example
rather than by force. In remarks that must
have come as a great relief to Latin American audiences weary of American aggression,
Hoover remarked: “True democracy is not
and cannot be imperialistic.”52•
Notes
This essay is dedicated to the memory of my colleague and friend James Chace, whose probing analyses of U.S. foreign policy warn of the dangers of unrestrained American power even when the intent is
to do good. I am grateful he was able to read and
comment upon this essay before his sudden and untimely death in October 2004.
1. The origins of democratic imperialism in
American history can be traced to the Spanish American war of 1898 and the occupation of Cuba and
Puerto Rico. For a concise view of American interventions in the name of democracy see Minxin Pei,
“Lessons from the Past,” Foreign Policy (July/August
2003).

4. Condoleezza Rice, “Promoting the National
Interest,” Foreign Affairs, vol. 79 (January/February

key principles for American foreign policy. Direct
promotion of democracy is not one of them, which
Rice dismisses as “a second-order effect.”

24. Debates about democratic peace theory are
hampered by the absence of scholarly consensus as to
what constitutes a democratic nation. Among the
most frequently cited examples of democracies going
to war with each other are the United States and
Britain in 1812, the United States and Spain in
1898, Finland and the Allied Powers during the
Second World War, and Israel and Lebanon in
1981.

26. The years since the mid-1970s have been described as “the greatest period of democratic ferment
in the history of modern civilization.” Between 1974
and 1990, 30 new democracies were established and
that number does not include the many new democracies launched with the collapse of communism. See
